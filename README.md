# Fish Tank JS

I love my goldfish, but my misspent youth means my memory is comparable to one. To ensure my beloved pets survival I've trained them to act as an http server and whenever I'm ready to feed them they'll return me the amount of food they require. To assist further I've trained my cat to report back to me which goldfish are currently alive and the urls the surviving goldfish are listening on.

Your task is to build a client page that reports how much to feed each fish and the total fish food I'll need.
