# Fish Tank JS

I love my goldfish, but my memory is comparable to one. To ensure my beloved pets survival I've trained them to act as an http server and whenever I'm ready to feed them they'll return me the amount of food they need. To assist further I've trained my cat to report back to me which goldfish are currently alive.

Your task is to build a client page that reports how much food I need to put into the tank.
